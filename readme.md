# Whitelist Manager - Minecraft Plugin ( DEV )

**Supported Version:** Bukkit 1.7.10   

## The Intent

This plugin is intended to manage a JSON feed of white-listed users and will work in conjunction with [Minecraft Suite](https://github.com/JayWood/minecraft-suite)
 which has yet to be officially released.
 
This plugin will sync regularly ( or on an interval you specify ) with the WordPress server to update it's local white-list.

## Still in development

This plugin is just a side-project and in no way should be considered complete. Therefore, compile and use at your own
risk, and therefore, tickets/issues will be ignored.
